    <h3>How to play:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by shooting zombies that are coming towards you.</li>
      <li>Use the arrow keys to move and rotate your player on the screen. You can move forward, backward, left or
        right.</li>
      <li>Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at the zombies. You can only shoot one bullet at a time.</li>
      <li>Each zombie has a health of 3 and can be killed by three bullets. You get points for killing zombies, depending
        on their size. Bigger zombies give more points than smaller ones.</li>
      <li>The zombies will spawn randomly from the edges of the screen and will chase you. They will also get faster and
        more frequent as you score more points.</li>
      <li>You have 3 lives to start with. You lose a life if a zombie touches you. You also become invulnerable for a
        short time after losing a life.</li>
      <li>The game is over when you lose all your lives.</li>
      <li>You can pause and resume the game by pressing the escape key.</li>
    </ul>
